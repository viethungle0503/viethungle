![A king looking out of his palace window](/img/blog/king-window.jpeg)

Once upon a time, in a grand palace, a king sat by his window when he heard a street vendor's call: "Milk fruits! Fresh and sweet milk fruits!" The king looked out and saw an old man pushing a cart of milk fruits, surrounded by eager customers.

The king's mouth watered, and he called his First Minister, handing him five gold coins: "Go and buy me some milk fruits."

The First Minister called the Ninth Minister and gave him four gold coins: "Run and buy the milk fruits."

The Ninth Minister summoned the Minister of Rites and gave him three gold coins: "Quick, get the milk fruits."

The Minister of Rites called the captain of the guards and gave him two gold coins: "Hurry, fetch the milk fruits."

The captain called a guard and gave him one gold coin: "Go get the milk fruits."

The guard marched out and grabbed the old vendor by the collar: "Hey, what are you shouting about? Get out of here! I'm confiscating all the milk fruits!"

The guard returned to the captain: "Here, sir. One gold coin got us half a cart of milk fruits."

The captain reported to the Minister of Rites: "Here, Your Excellency. Two gold coins got us a sack of milk fruits."

The Minister of Rites told the Ninth Minister: "Here, three gold coins got us a bag of milk fruits."

The Ninth Minister reported to the First Minister: "Here, four gold coins got us half a bag. What can we do, sir? It's inflation."

The First Minister appeared before the king: "Your Majesty, as ordered, here are five milk fruits."

The king sat in his palace, pondering: "Five milk fruits for five gold coins, one gold coin per fruit, and people are fighting to buy them. We need to increase taxes on the people."

And so, everything became more expensive.
